          "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Product and some info about QR codes and some easy help to Label Refill woes and confusion.",
          "reviewText": "This product is just great. I have been using it for several weeks now and am constantly in the app thinking up new label ideas.D30 Printer - The product itself is well made, put simply it just works as intended. The printing is fast even if you print a solid black label and DPI is the highest and same as any of the other competitors available. When printing super small there may be some issues with text and legibility. I prefer to keep things simple with 1 or 2 line of big text. At 3 lines it is 100% readable as well. When you start putting super tiny text on there the letters begin to not print as intended due to problems with DPI if I am not mistaken. Letters may not print as they are supposed look thus making it hard to read. We are talking super small at this point though and it is unreasonable to expect to get micro text out of this thing that most people would need magnification to read anyways. Icons still look pretty good even at fairly small sizes. Just buy this one, it is the best one because it has the best ecosystem, the printer is easily equal or best... don't buy it based on just looks but it looks/is decent, app which is super important is complete meaning all it's features work unlike many other printers and it has the most label refill options.The APP - The app you need to download can be downloaded and tested before you even buy. I did just that with this and other best sellers and found this app had more icons and the competing apps actually had a similar app always but lacked icons, had usability issues, and some features that did not work yet because the app was not done yet but they still promote the app features as if they worked. This app seems to me like the best app thus making this the best printer IMHO because the app is the most important part of this whole printer label thing. If you are like me you will be spending most of the time with your phone and the app not holding the printer itself obviously until you need to grab your label(s). It may seem trivial but the app is super fun because you get to create things there then ultimately print them out on labels. The app lets you save all your labels and also manage them by deleting some if you want to get rid of some. The app has two modes, a basic simple mode and a more comprehensive mode. Tbh they are both modes are fine and comprehensive mode is very easy to use and has many features to help you create with great tiny precision so I just use that by default. The comprehensive mode is very intuitive and easy to learn to use. I have been in the app a ton since I got the printer and am always creating something new or saving labels I will print or that are or will be handy or fun to use now or later. Again saving everything is huge, because if you print the same things often you can simply select it before you enter creation mode and just print it.QR Code feature in the app - Short version is it works for sure, but filling it to the 200 character limit seems unprintable no matter what. There are two small problems. 1) First, in the app if you increase the size of the of the QR code via dragging the corner it can sometimes distort the shape. This is doesn't happen every time and I would call it a bug. You want to keep it Square. I suggest two things if resizing the QR code. Copy your text to clipboard before finishing the QR code. Hit the check mark to place it. Don't move it from where it initially appears on the app, resize it in baby steps and remember there is an undo button if the QR code distorts. If trying for max size move it to the top left corner, then finish resizing it to the max. A max size QR code code does work, so does a smaller default size smaller QR code but the number of characters used may make a difference. Also alternately, instead of undo if you distort the QR code, if you have trouble just delete it and make a new one, paste the clipboard, and try again. The real problem is it seems you cannot use the full 200/200 character limit as I am about to explain. 2) Second links and info work fine in the QR code depending on error correction and size, but you can only use so many characters. I tried using the maximum and it could not be read with it set to either LOW or SUPER as the error correction level. I took a only minutes and printed a few tests and I can print 100/200 characters of text at LOW error correction but not at SUPER error correction. At SUPER, 100 characters, the corners were distorted enough where I could tell directly from the app it was unprintable because the corner blocks were too small to be printed due to DPI limitations. I am sure I can go higher than 100 on LOW for example, but I didn't want to do a super comprehensive definitive test just for my review. I suggest you guys play around with both character limit and error correction and don't distort your QR codes!Label refills - Some people and reviewers have had trouble with refills. I came across the same issue as another reviewer yet his solution was drastically different and complicated but the actual issue is trivial but an understandable mistake. The D30 Printer comes pre-loaded with a roll of labels. The labels face outward and you are supposed to put the label side facing the printer head thus it feeds through the left of the circular chamber when you use that first roll. However the refills I purchased came wound up differently so the label faced the inward. I believe this may have been a change in the way they were wound up by the manufacturer and that is all. This means that to get the labels on the printer head you need to feed them through the right side of the circular chamber instead(see my image, that is a refill roll fed through right side). That is all. To me it was obvious but I understand the confusion as the product didn't comer out of the box that way and I too initially fed the refill roll to the left and was confused. Again to recap the D30 comes with a roll with labels on the outside/up and the refills seem to be wound now with the label facing inside/down so need to be fed through the right. Just remember label has to face the printer head or it will obviously try and print on the back of the label paper that you throw away.Customer Support - Top notch 5 Star customer support that responded pretty fast. I genuinely believe they are trying hard to support their products and will continue well into the future and meet their customers expectations and are responsive to feedback and actually try to fix issues that arise.At times I am so bored but since getting the D30 printer I have been so distracted and immersed for weeks in the app creating and thinking of new labels. I have even seen some mental health benefits, my anxiety and stress I suffer from have gone down some because I am in the app so often. Who knew a simple label maker could be so fun!",

          "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Super Easy To Use - Get Labeling!",
          "reviewText": "I'm kind of a freak about organization and I label EVERYTHING, so thank goodness this little printer is almost effortless to use. Similar in size to a cell phone about twice as thick, but way lighter, making it easy to pop into your purse, backpack, or briefcase if you need to. The biggest issue I have with thermal printers is normally loading the paper correctly. This printer is easy to load. Just seat the spool onto the raised circle and feed the end of the label into the narrow slot. Close the lid and press the button on the top of the machine and it will auto-feed the label to the correct position. You will be sacrificing the first label, but that's typical in my experience. It doesn't matter if you feed a little or a lot into the slot, the auto-feed will correctly set the label regardless. As you can see in the picture, the ends of the label are perfectly centered, which is because of the auto-feed setting positioning the label in the right place. The border, however, is pretty tight to the bottom of the label, but that's more likely a software issue because from the print screen on my phone it looks perfectly centered and the paper is seated properly in the printer. The print quality is good, but I find that it helps if my text is medium to large in relation to the size of the label for the best quality. I generally prefer labels with larger text anyway, since the point of putting a label on something is to be able to identify what it is at a glance.The uses for this label printer are virtually endless. From spice jars to file folders and everything in between, if it needs a label, you can make one with this printer. I have another label printer similar to this one, but it's difficult to get the label tape perfectly installed and it has to be plugged in when you want to use it because it's not rechargeable. This printer is rechargeable which makes a big difference because I can easily take it into the kitchen or the office depending on what I need to do with it. It uses a micro USB for recharging and a charging cable is included for your convenience. Mine arrived without a usable charge, but it only takes a few hours to fully charge it. I plugged it in to charge around midday, and it was already charged when I checked it around dinner time. It has a little cutout on one end where you could easily attach a lanyard (not included) if you wanted to which might be handy depending on your individual usage habits.The app you need to create and print labels is easy to use and there's a huge selection of fonts, icons, borders, and templates. You can also create and save your own templates if you have a particular type of label you make frequently. I find this useful for creating food storage labels so that I know the date I put something in the freezer or pantry. Phomemo also has a lot of different label styles, so you're not just stuck with the plain old boring white ones. It's nice that you can get different colors to showcase your own personal style. There's no comprehensive list of labels that are compatible with this printer, but it supports thermal labels that range from 12-15mm wide, and you can use either the precut or continuous labels. If you search \"D30 labels\" on Amazon, you'll see there are tons of choices out there.The device is almost genius in its simplicity. There is a single light that illuminates when the device is turned on, blinks when it's charging, turns solid red if there's a problem like the cover is open or there are no labels installed, and blinks red when you're running low on power. I initially thought the round black circle was some sort of display when I unboxed the printer, but it's purely decorative and makes the printer look kind of like a vintage radio. As I already described, the labels are easy to load, and the only other part of the device you'll use is the charging port. Everything else is controlled via the app.The app has a lot to offer, but as with anything new, it will take some time playing around with it to discover all the features and how to apply them. When you open the app, you'll see at the very top there is a section labeled \"Operations Guide.\" If you click it and select the model of the device (D30) you'll see a number of topics to help you navigate and get to know the software including how to create a label, how to center text, and so on. When you click on them, it takes you to an instructional video which is infinitely more useful than reading a manual. If you just want to go for it, I have found that just playing with the different settings and features has worked well for me. The label I made as a test for this review took around 5 minutes to create, so it's pretty easy to intuit your way around. There are hardware instructions as well, and from there you will find the entire instruction manual (great in the event you lose your paper copy) as well as a video showing how to clean the print head. If you still need help, there is a \"contact us\" link from your profile page in the app as well as a live chat. So, no need to be intimidated by this cute little machine!All in all, this is a great label maker that you can use throughout your home and office. I find myself using it every week, mostly for food-related stuff, but also in my office when I need a file folder labeled. It's also great for labeling things for storage. The labels themselves are easy to use and easy to remove from most things. If you're putting them on food storage containers that you intend to refill, you can even wash the container, and the label will stay put and not smudge - although they won't do as well in the dishwasher. What I really love is that I'm no longer tethered to my computer to make labels with this compact rechargeable printer. The only thing I wish this printer could do is recognize the label size automatically. Maybe AI will get us there eventually. As it is, it's hard not to love this little cutie!",

          "reviewText": "I’m not a stranger to making labels for just about anything…on my makeup packages with discard dates, the never ending parade of charging cables, leftovers, food I’m freezing etc. They really help me keep things straight. That being said, I was intrigued by this model that’s much smaller than my current one.At first I was turned off by the separated labels that came with it rather than the long, continuous label that my old one uses. I wasted quite a few labels trying to get it to line up correctly. No biggie, I can just buy continuous labels once these are gone. But there is no built in label cutter like my old one, so I’ll need to keep scissors handy, not a huge deal but a minor inconvenience.The app is free (and the same app my other printer uses even though they are completely different brands). There’s a “lite” mode and a “creative” mode. Lite mode has literally a hundred or so labels premade and ready to go with general household labels (categories for cleaning, spices etc.) Creative mode gives you a ton of options: font, size, boarders, symbols, emojis, gift tags and the like. After a few days of trial and error I’ve gotten the hang of it. Time will tell if it stands up to my almost daily label needs.I think it will be a nice replacement for my bigger, older model. I docked one star for not having a built in label cutter. Not an issue if you’re using the separated labels and not the continuous kind, which I prefer.",

Also there was a heavy smoker in the home. So a mixture of nicotine, dust and grease vapor from cooking all settled onto the top of those things into a disgusting substance. Dawn couldn't touch it. It took 3 layers of product, but it completely broke down all the grease and eventually I got it looking brand new up there. I also cleaned the microwave, under the range, lots of places that were gross and neglected and it did an awesome job. Everything looks 1000 times better. And it disinfects! And smells good! Oh, and good size and cheap!",
